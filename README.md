This code reads stock price data from a CSV file, specifically extracting the "Last Traded Price" (LTP) for analysis. 
It performs a Monte Carlo simulation to project future stock prices over a user-defined number of days and trials by generating random price changes. 
After the simulation, it calculates the average (mean) and variability (standard deviation) of the final simulated prices and creates a plot to visualize the different price paths. 
Finally, it outputs the average price and standard deviation, providing insights into potential future stock price movements based on historical data.
